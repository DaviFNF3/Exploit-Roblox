# Exploit-Template-v2

Here's my exploit template version 2; I'll update this github with changes as I work on it; it's a side project, so don't expect much; I would've included a real key system, but then you would not even useÂ my new key gen. KEKW

all i did was the key system page as of rn, started designing the ui wont push that tell later heres a look though.
